Grading Easier
===

1. Read some score sign('o','x') from CSV
2. Make a comment from some sign data
3. Write some score point(1,2) to CSV
4. Read score point CSV and Email


\* 1~3 processes can be done by executing `score-comment-executor.py`

\* I used the Sendgrid. this is useful for email service. (like mailgun)
