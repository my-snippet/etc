BIOS loads OS. But what is BIOS?

1. Basic Input/Output System
2. A type of firmware
3. From 1 & 2, BIOS can access basic devices(disks, keyboard, ...)
4. BIOS contents are stored on flash memory
5. From 4, It can be rewritten without removing the chip

-----

Consideration

- From 5, When the hardware disposition changes, BIOS'll also need to rewrite it.
- If BIOS loads OS, What calls BIOS?
